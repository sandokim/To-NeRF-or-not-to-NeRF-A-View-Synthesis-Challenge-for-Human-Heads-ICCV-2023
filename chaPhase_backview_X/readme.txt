Other description: The solution uses the TensoRF of A. Chen, Z. Xu et al. ECCV 2022 as a base model. On top of the base model, we enhanced the base model by implementing backside view exclusion. We have a Python implementation and report single-core CPU runtime. The method was trained mainly on the Imperial Light-Stage Head dataset.
